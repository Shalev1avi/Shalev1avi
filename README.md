**Slide 1: What is Malware?**
- **Definition**: Malware is malicious software designed to harm computers, steal information, or perform other illegal actions.
- **Main Categories**:
  - **Viruses**
  - **Worms**
  - **Trojans**
  - **Ransomware**
  - **Spyware**: Software designed to secretly collect information from the victim's computer or phone without their knowledge.

**Slide 2: The WannaCry Attack**
- **Date and Prevalence**: May 2017, affecting approximately 200,000 systems in 150 countries.
- **Mechanism**: Exploiting a security vulnerability in Windows, encrypting files, and demanding ransom.
- **Damage**: Disruption of critical systems, immense economic damage.

**Slide 3: The Petya Attack**
- **Background on Petya**: First appeared in March 2016, with an upgraded version, NotPetya, in June 2017.
- **Mechanism**: Encrypting the Master Boot Record (MBR), exploiting the EternalBlue vulnerability.
- **Damage**: Impact on critical infrastructures, causing over $10 billion in damages.

**Slide 4: Pegasus â€“ Advanced Digital Espionage**
- **What is Pegasus?**: An advanced spyware developed by the Israeli company NSO Group.
- **Targets**: Designed to track individuals such as journalists, human rights activists, and prominent figures by infiltrating mobile phones.
- **Mechanism**:
  - Ability to penetrate without user interaction (such as clicking a link).
  - Access to messages, emails, real-time locations, and calls.
- **Notable Cases**: Reports of Pegasus being used to monitor figures like journalists and political activists in various countries, leading to global criticism.

**Slide 5: Comparison Between WannaCry, Petya, and Pegasus**
- **Objectives**:
  - WannaCry and Petya focus on economic damage through encryption and ransom demands.
  - Pegasus focuses on gathering confidential information and monitoring specific targets.
- *Distribution*:
  - WannaCry and Petya exploited vulnerabilities and spread quickly.
  - Pegasus operates more targetedly, sent to mobile phones.
- *Impact*: While WannaCry and Petya caused widespread economic damage, Pegasus led to political and social upheaval due to privacy breaches.

*Slide 6: Lessons and Prevention*
- *System and Security Upgrades*: Keeping systems regularly updated.
- *Backup Policies*: Regular backups stored separately.
- *Awareness and Training*: Educating people on privacy protection and understanding the risks.
- *Oversight and Transparency*: The need for oversight of companies developing spyware and transparency about its use.

*Slide 7: Global Response to Cyber Attacks*
- *Governmental and International Response*: Cooperation between nations, strengthening regulations.
- *Development of Security Technologies*: Technologies to prevent intrusions and secure information.
- *Future Implications*: Maintaining a balance between national security needs and individual privacy.
